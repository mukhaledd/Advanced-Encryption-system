##  About <a name = "about"></a>
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifies a FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a
symmetric block cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext, decrypting the ciphertext
converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext.

##  Applicability <a name = "applicability"></a>
- This standard may be used by Federal departments and agencies when an agency determines that sensitive ***(unclassified)*** information requires cryptographic protection.
- In addition, this standard may be adopted and used by non-Federal Government organizations. Such use is encouraged when it provides the desired security for commercial and private organizations.
